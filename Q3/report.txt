Q3.1

Linear Regression - 
	Training Accuracy: 86%
	Testing Accuracy: 82%

SVM -
	Training Accuracy: 98%
	Testing Accuracy: 96%

MLP - 
	Training Accuracy: 100%
	Testing Accuracy: 81%

Random Forest - 
	Training Accuracy: 100%
	Testing Accuracy: 95%

****************************************
Q3.2 - Hyperparameter tuning

Random Forest - 
	n_estimators values tested (at least 3): 100, 200, 500

	max_depth values tested (at least 3): 5,10,50,100
		
	Best combination of parameter values:
		n_estimators: 500
		max_depth: 50

	Testing Accuracy before tuning (default parameters): 95%
	Testing Accuracy after tuning: 96%


SVM -
	Kernels values tested: rbf, linear
	C values tested (at least 3): 0.0001, 0.1, 100
		
	Best combination of parameter values: 
		Kernel: rbf
		C: 100

	Testing Accuracy before tuning (default parameters): 96%
	Testing Accuracy after tuning: 97%

****************************************
Q3.3

For your SVM's CV run from Q3.2, state the highest mean testing accuracy 
across the sets of parameter values and its corresponding mean train score and mean fit time. 

SVM's highest mean testing/cross-validated accuracy (best score): 97%
SVM's mean train score: 100%
SVM's mean fit time: 0.043

****************************************
Q3.4

Best Classifier: Random Forest Classifier
Why: Random Forest achieves the highest 100% training Accuracy, 95% test accuracy, 96% test accuracy after tunning. The fit time is much faster SVM without standardizing the data though SVM is 1% more accurate. Individual decision trees can be trained in parallel, reduces overfitting, which ensures faster performance and higher accuracy.
